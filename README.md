# All things java , data structures and algorithms

- Java basics
  - Running code using the terminal covering custom class path
  - Read and dump command line arguments
  - max of 3 nos
  - nth fibonacci no, factorial
  - find occurance of x in a integer n
  - reverse an integer, isPalindrome (leverage reverseInteger)
  - check if the no is prime or not
  - conditionals, switch, var args
  - armstrong no (sum of cubes of all digits == n)

- array, arraylists, 2d array
  - lists, arraylists, multi-d arrays, reverse a list, find max
  - leetcode 1295 - find nos with even digits in an array
  = leetcode 1470 - shuffle/rearrange a array of size 2n

- search
  - linear search, binary search, order agnostic bin search

- binary search
  - find ceiling, floor for a no in an array
  - leetcode754 - find celing in char array
  - leetcode34 - find (start, end) in sorted array for target
  - binSearch on an infinite sorted array (amz)
  - search for an element in mountain array (increases , then decreases)

- threads
  - basic code to print100 nos all in their own threads
  - threadpool - print100 nos constrained by the pool size
